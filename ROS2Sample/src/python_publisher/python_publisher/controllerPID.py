@description:

    Simple implementation of a PID controller for a closed loop control system.
    As of now by setting either Ki or Kd equal to zero you can use, respectively
    a PD or a PI controller. If you set all three the parameters then you'll be 
    using a PID.
    
    The PID is provided with a raw (to be improved) anti-windup system.
